 Bio:
<p>
 I am a girl who has had many problems in life and a girl who has also solved those problems on her own.<br>
</p>
<p>
 I grew up in a very strict home. My biggest dream would be to get into an IV league school in NewYork, get into medicle school, and become succesful.<br>
</p>
<p>
 My greatest dream is to take care of my mum because she has beeen through alot for the sake of I and my brother.<br>
</p>
<p>
 Enough about the depressing and sad things, asides from these goals which I have listed I would like to start my own natural hair products line.<br>
</p>

</p>
<p>
  What inspired me or how did I come up with this idea?
</p>
<p>
  Two years ago I used to perm my hair regularly and funny enough it was not damaging my hair but I kept wondering if My hair would remain healthy in more years to come,<br>
</p>
  so I made a decision to stop perming my hair, Although my journey was not easy my hair is now thick, full and black.<br>
<p>
 Going natural was the best thing i did and since then I have been advising friends and family to stop perming their hair and I strongly advice you too, YES YOU! (if you are in the habit of perming your hair)<br>
</p>
<p>
 What is the sole purpose of BROWN HONEY?
</p>
<p>
  The sole pyrpose of BROWN HONEY is to create a different alternative for girls with natural hair in a way that we dont discriminate against hair types (3c,4c...).<br>
</p>
<p>
  We want to be the one natiral hair product you can trust because we strictly use natural products.<br>
